# n-Queens Problem
Given a chessboard of any size, this program finds the configuration of the most number of queens that can be placed without any in the path of any other.

This problem comes from the eight queens puzzle which is generalized to the n-queens problem. A chessboard of n size will always fit n queens where none are in the path of any other, except n = 2 and n = 3. This program displays that configuration.
